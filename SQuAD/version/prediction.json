when the new york giants lost to the san francisco 49ers. cowboys quarterback tony romo faced off against his boyhood idol brett favre in the game. the packers started the game missing two key players of their defense, with injured cornerback charles woodson (tied for 7th in the nfl with 4 interceptions) and pass-rushing end kabeer gbaja-biamila (tied for 6th in the nfl with 9.5 sacks) on the inactive list. in the first quarter, green bay took the early lead as rookie kicker mason crosby completed a 47-yard field goal. on the first play of the cowboys opening drive, al harris stripped the ball from terrell owens and side judge laird hayes signaled green bay ball, but head linesman derick bowers overruled him. the only option for mike mccarthy to challenge on the play, since the whistle was blown, was whether it was a reception - the strip could not be reviewed. the replay upheld the reception and dallas retained possession.  nick folk completed a 26-yard field goal to tie the game. folk also completed a 51-yard field goal, and qb tony romo threw a 3-yard td pass to wr patrick crayton. the packers would end the first quarter with rookie rb ryan grant running for a 62-yard touchdown. in the second quarter, dallas responded with romo completing a 26-yard td pass to te anthony fasano and a 10-yard td pass to wr terrell owens.  brett favre left the game in the second quarter after he hit his right elbow on the helmet of a blitzing cowboys db nate jones. the throw led to favre s second interception. packers quarterback aaron rodgers took over for the packers next series and led the offense on a 74-yard drive, capping it off with an 11-yard td pass to wr greg jennings. in the third, grant finished off a 69-yard packer drive with a 1-yard td run for the only score of the quarter. in the fourth quarter, romo completed a 4-yard td pass to crayton. mason crosby kicked a 52-yard field goal with just over 5 minutes remaining in the game to pull the packers within a field goal. dallas sealed the win as folk kicked a 25-yard field goal with 1:03 left in the game. the packers were flagged for a season-high 142 penalty yards.", "problem": "how long were

revolution. newly emancipated peasants earned too little and were not allowed to sell or mortgage their allotted land. ethnic minorities resented the government because of its russification, discrimination and repression, such as banning them from voting and serving in the imperial guard or navy and limited attendance in schools. a nascent industrial working class resented the government for doing too little to protect them, banning strikes and labor unions. finally, radical ideas fomented and spread after a relaxing of discipline in universities allowed a new consciousness to grow among students. taken individually, these issues might not have affected the course of russian history, but together they created the conditions for a potential revolution. at the turn of the century, discontent with the tsar s dictatorship was manifested not only through the growth of political parties dedicated to the overthrow of the monarchy but also through industrial strikes for better wages and working conditions, protests and riots among peasants, university demonstrations, and the assassination of government officials, often done by socialist revolutionaries. because the russian economy was tied to european finances, the contraction of western money markets in 1899-1900 plunged russian industry into a deep and prolonged crisis which outlasted the dip in european industrial production. this setback aggravated social unrest during the five years preceding the revolution of 1905. the government finally recognized these problems, albeit in a shortsighted and narrow-minded way. the minister of interior plehve stated in 1903 that, after the agrarian problem, the most serious issues plaguing the country were those of the jews, the schools, and the workers, in that

ruler naresuen attacked cambodia in order to fight the burmese. later on, in may 1593, 100,000 thai  soldiers invaded cambodia. as a result of the thai s invasion, lovek was conquered in july 1594. in

veloso succeeded in establishing king barom reachea ii in may 1597. private individuals of muslim malays, chams, cambodians retaliated to spain and portugal s invasion by slaughtering the spanish and portuguese, including diogo veloso. only a few filipinos and one spaniard survived the massacre. because of the massacre, spain s planned christianization of cambodia failed. after the attack,

its name to the vhf teletype society and started us amateur radio operations on 2 meters using audio frequency shift keying (afsk). the first two-way amateur radioteletype q code of record took place in may 1946 between dave winters, w2auf, brooklyn, ny and w2bfd, john evans williams, woodside long island, ny. on the west coast, amateur rtty also started on 2 meters. operation on 80 meters, 40

successfully petitioned the u.s. federal communications commission (fcc) to amend part 12 of the regulations, which was effective on february 20, 1953. the amended regulations permitted fsk in the

specified. amateur radio operators also had to identify their station callsign at the beginning and the end of each transmission and at ten-minute intervals using international morse code. use of this

quarterback brett hundley s struggles in the previous week s 30-17 loss to the lions. although the bears had not defeated the packers at home since 2010, the packers were 2-3 since the two teams  last meeting in week four, while green bay head coach mike mccarthy was 1-3 against the bears without rodgers. jeff joniak described his ideal bears offensive gameplan as laying a clean game to avoid swinging the tempo or momentum in favor of a team that s on a three-game losing streak. to do this, mitchell trubisky would have to avoid getting sacked, while the running game would have to reduce its runs resulting in negative yardage. through the air, the bears remained an unknown entity due to a lack of available film on trubisky and receivers markus wheaton and dontrelle inman, the latter making his bears debut in week ten after being traded to the team in late october. on defense, joniak wrote the unit needed to prevent hundley from developing his accuracy, especially as the chicago defense was excelling in preventing touchdowns, along with containing running back ty montgomery, who recorded 162 rushing yards on 16 carries against the bears in week sixteen last year. in a game that chicagobears.com writer larry mayer described as having  to an early-season trend, the bears shot themselves in the foot repeatedly, chicago struggled with penalties during the game as the team committed seven in the first half. the bears punted on the first drive, which led to an exchanging of field goals on mason crosby s 40- and connor barth s 45-yard kicks. three drives later, in the second quarter, montgomery scored on a 37-yard touchdown run to give the packers the lead. on the next drive, trubisky threw a screen pass to benny cunningham, who ran to the packers  goal line and dived for the pylon. his knee landed out of bounds and the play was ruled as such at the two-yard line, which the bears challenged with the belief that the ball had reached the pylon before he went out; instead, the challenge went against the bears when it was determined he had lost the ball before it had touched the pylon, resulting in a touchback and possession being granted to the packers. chicago eventually added three more points on barth s 44-yard field goal as time expired in the first half. crosby kicked a 24-yard field goal on the first drive of the second half, which was followed by one from 50 yards in the fourth quarter. the bears ended their touchdown-scoring troubles (scoring just one touchdown in 35 drives across the previous four games) when trubisky threw a 46-yard touchdown pass to josh bellamy, who escaped davon house for the score. however, the packers responded with a 75-yard drive that ended with hundley s 19-yard touchdown pass to davante adams. barth added a 49-yard field goal to draw the bears within a touchdown, and remained in contention when crosby missed a 35-yarder wide right with 1:02 left in the game. after completing an 11-yard pass to
